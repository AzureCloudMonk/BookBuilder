# AtomicKotlinBuilder

- Requires Python 3.4+
- All functionality is collected under the single `akb` command which will be installed automatically

## To Install
- Download and unzip (or git clone)
- Move to the base directory where you unzipped or cloned it

You must enter the virtual environment before you can use `akb`.

## To Enter the Virtual Environment (Windows)
- Run `venv.bat`. The first time, this will set up the virtual environment and enter it.
- From now on, running `venv` will enter the virtual environment.


## To Enter the Virtual Environment (Mac/Linux)


## Running `akb`
- Run `akb`. This will indicate the basic commands
- To find out more about a command, run `akb` *the_command* `--help`


## To Quit the Virtual Environment

You'll know that you're inside the virtual environment because of the
`(virtualenv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

### Windows: type `venv`

### Mac/Linux: type `deactivate`

In either case, the `(virtualenv)` will disappear from your command prompt.
